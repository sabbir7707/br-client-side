                        <p>This is a well-refined course that provides three full days of instruction. As a consultant, there was not a scenario left unexplored </p>
                        <p>Every scenario and question I had was answered within the training. If you don’t have the opportunity to attend in person, definitely take advantage of the self-paced training.It was great to have my team member on this course learning at the same time and able to help each other. Attending over the internet was great!</p>
